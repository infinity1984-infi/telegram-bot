# Telegram Batch Video Bot

A simple bot that replies with a video (or media) based on user input number by fetching it from a batch channel.

## ðŸš€ Setup

1. Clone the repo or unzip files.
2. Fill in your `.env` file with API_ID, API_HASH, and BOT_TOKEN.
3. Deploy using Docker or run locally.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- User types `1`
- Bot fetches message 2 from batch channel (hardcoded `-1002610839118`)
- Sends the media directly to the user (no file links).
